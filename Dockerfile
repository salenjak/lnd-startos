# v0.21's image switched base from Debian to Alpine and dropped curl, which the
# startos layer shells into the container for (wallet init/unlock, the migration's
# state polling — all hit LND's REST endpoint). Restore it. sqlite3 is for the
# migration's zombie-index scrub (startos/sqliteBackend.ts); ssh and sshpass are
# how the Initialize Wallet migrations pull an LND data directory off the origin
# node (assets/import-*.sh).
